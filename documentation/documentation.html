                    <h3 id ="purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this web application is to allow users to acces a plethora of different resources regarding "Creative Coding". "Creative Coding" focuses on form rather than function and allows programmers to access their creative side. The app will act similarly to a search engine or a collection of multiple links to different resources from the web.

                    <h3 id="product_functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
                    <p>The application will allow its users to mainly access 2 big functionalities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessing/searching for different resources about Creative Coding(articles, books, repositories, tutorials, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Add new resources related to Creative Coding</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Besides these 2 main functions, the users will be able to access their own account, modify their personal data and save certain resources to their profile for ease of access.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3 id="user_classes">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>As far as user types are concerned, the application limits users by the login/signup protocol. We have 2 main categories of users: the ones with an account and the ones without an account. </p>
                    <p>A user without an account, who might be accessing the platform only once or rarely, may not want to create an account and only want to quickly reach the information they need.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, users who choose to create an account and frequently access the platform will have the possibility to also add new resources to the database, therefore contributing to the creative coding space.</p>

                <h2 id="external_interface_requirements">3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="user_interface">3.1 User Interface</h3>
                    <p>In the following sections, there will be a presentation of each page/interface of the app where the user can interact with the functionality.</p>
                    <h4>Search Page</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="Search Page">
                        <img src="./public/search.png" alt="Search Page/Landing Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>The landing page of the application is represented by the Search Page. Designed to be minimalist and easy to use, this page allows the users to access 2 main functionalities: search and login/singup. In this way, the user can branch out into the different pages of the platform by searching for a resource(which redirects the user to the Search Result page) or by loggin in(which redirects the user to the Login/Sign-up page).</p>
                    <h4>Search Result Page</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="SearchResults Page">
                        <img src="./public/searchResult.png" alt="Search Results Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>The Search Result page is an interface of the app that the user will reach after inputing a search string in the Search Bar. The page will return the available resources that match with the keywords in the search input. Also, on this page, the user can use filters(in the left side menu) to reduce the number of resources found to his/her preferences. Filters can include things like the prefered programming language, the type of resource, etc. Also, a common element between all pages(except Search Page) is the header, which will be kept the same across the whole app for easier access to certain functionalities.</p>
                    <h4>Login/Sign-Up Page</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="Login Page">
                        <img src="./public/login.png" alt="Login Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="SignUp Page">
                        <img src="./public/signup.png" alt="SignUp Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>These 2 pages- represent a basic login/signup module for our application. Here, the user will input their credentials that will be validated and if the validation is successful, the user will be redirected to the Search Page, but with new functionalities available(Account Page + Add Resources Page).</p>
                    <p>In the case of a sign up, a new user will be created and the same flow as in the case of the login will be applied.</p>
                    <h4>Account Page</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="Account Page">
                        <img src="./public/account.png" alt="Account Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the account page, a logged user can perform update actions on his personal info(Email, password, name, etc.). Also, here the user will have the possibility to see a list of saved resources, where he can access them faster than searching again for that specific resource. Again, the same common header is kept on this page as well.</p>
                    <h4>Add Resource Page</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="AddResource Page">
                        <img src="./public/addResource.png" alt="Add Resource Page" style="width:40%; height:40%;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the add resource page, the user has the ability to add a new resource to the project database that can be looked up by future users. For adding a valid resource, the user will have to fill a certain amount of required data about the new resource(name, address, type, a short description). Also, the app allows for multiple "tags" to be added to the resource, by using a list.</p>
                    <h4>Usecase Diagram</h4>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image" figcaption="Usecase Diagram">
                        <img src="./public/CroG.drawio (1).png" alt="Usecase diagram for CroG user flow.">
                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>The following diagram acts as a representation for the flow of our application. A user will arrive at the Search Page and can choose to search for a resource with or without being logged in. After introducing the search input, the user will be redirected to the Search Result Page where he can filter further the search results or, if logged in, can save a certain resource to his profile for easier access.</p>
                    <p>If the user chooses to login or sign up, he will be redirected to the login page where his credentials will be validated. Or, if he signs up, a new user will be created with the credeantials he/she introduced. After a valid login/sign-up the user will have acces to the Search function as before, but besides, he will have access to the Account Info and Resources Functions.</p>
                    <p>After accessing the Account Page, the user will have the ability to update his personal info or see a list of saved resources associated with his profile.</p>
                    <p>When accessing the Resources Page, the user can add a new resource to the database of resources. This will be done by filling a form with the required data of a resource(name, description, category, type, etc.)</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="hardware_interface">3.2 Hardware Interface</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to interaction between the different functionalities of the project, they will be managed by the Nodejs server and will be represented by sending/receiving different data such as login information, search terms, filters, user data, etc. When it comes to saving resources, we will use JSON files for better structuring our database.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="software_interface">3.3 Software Interface</h3>
                    <p>In order to build the project we decided to integrate different tools and libraries as well as combining different languages to create the features we need. To list some of the tehnologies used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Node.js</em>-building the backend server of the app.</li>
                        <li><em>HTML+CSS</em>-building the frontend of the app.</li>
                        <li><em>JavaScript</em>-for integrating and passing data between the components of the app.</li>
                        <li><em>MySQL</em>-for managing the database(subjected to change in the future, if needed).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In terms of other sofware components used to develop and use our application, we just need a web browser that has developer tools integrated. The app is OS independent.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="communications_interface">3.4 Communications Interface</h3>
                    <p>In order to ensure a proper communication, the application must be run in a browser and must have access to the network. The application has to be connected to the database in order to consistently return the corresponding resources that are searched. Also, in order to ensure user safety the password will be encrypted when being sent to the backend for checking validity. Because the application is built using Node.js, it is mandatory that the backend and frontend will communicate using asynchronous functions. Also, the HTTP protocol will facilitate the communication whitin the app.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3 id="keyword_feature">4.1 Keyword Matching & Filtering</h3>
                    <p><em>Priority:</em> High</p>
                    <p><em>Stimulus/Response Sequences:</em> Input at the search bar in the main page from users.</p>
                    <p><em>Functional Requirements:</em> Connection to the database.</p>
                    <p>One of the main features of our project is the Search option. Similar to a search engine, the user can input what he wants to search and the input will be parsed and separated into tokens. These tokens will then be matched with a series of keywords available in our database in order to return a search result catered to the user's needs. For example, if the user search input is "Websites in Java", the input will be broken down into 3 tokens and the first token, "Websites" will be a match with certain resources tagged with the same keyword.</p>
                    <p>Besides the keyword matching, we can narrow the search results even more by using filters. The search results page will have a side menu with filters that can be applied to the current query. For example, the user might filter by the preffered programming language(Java, Python, C/C++) or by the type of resource available(Book, article, repository, video tutorial) or even by difficulty, author, etc.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="resource_feature">4.2 Adding Resources</h3>
                    <p><em>Priority:</em> High</p>
                    <p><em>Stimulus/Response Sequences:</em>After a succesful login attempt, the user may press the Add button in order to add a new resource on the platform.</p>
                    <p><em>Functional Requirements:</em>Connection to the database + valid login.</p>
                    <p>One other important functionality that must be present on the platform is the possibility of adding new resources. This functionality is ensured by using a dedicated page where the user will be prompted with a form where he can input the name, a short description, an address and a list of "tags" for the resource that he/she wishes to add to the actual database.</p>
                    <p>This option will only be available for logged in users, as it can be quite sensitive because it creates modifications in the database of the project.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="profile_feature">4.3 Profile Info Update</h3>
                    <p><em>Priority:</em> Low</p>
                    <p><em>Stimulus/Response Sequences:</em> After successfully logging in, the user can access his/her profile by clicking the user icon.</p>
                    <p><em>Functional Requirements:</em> Connection to the database + valid login.</p>
                    <p>The user will be redirected to a page where he can view/edit personal data and manage a list of saved/starred resources that can be accessed quicker.</p>

                    <p>The resources available at CroG are taken from the Creative Coding repository on GitHub. The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3 id="wireframing">5.2 Wireframing tool</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to have a clear representation of what our application wanted to look like. So, starting from hand drawn sketches, we used a wireframing tool in order to create the interface of our application as close to its implemented form as possible. To achieve this, we used Figma, a powerful tool which allowed us to quickly recreate the aspect that we've envisioned. Our Figma project is available at the following <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DLRuBAJH94Wa8G1dAupiSv/CroG?node-id=0%3A1&t=7GtQnPFf7SQ6bQbS-1">link</a>.</p>

                    <p>Our communication was ensured asynchronously by Discord and for a better project management we chose to work on a GitHub repository. The link to our GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/Darius1509/CroG">here</a>.</p>
